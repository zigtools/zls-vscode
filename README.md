# zls-vscode
`zls-vscode` is a language client extension for [`zls`](https://github.com/zigtools/zls), the awesome Zig Language Server.

## Installing

`zls-vscode` is the client extension for [ZLS](https://github.com/zigtools/zls). This means, **you will need to have ZLS compiled and configured** to use this extension, as this extension only *bridges* ZLS to Visual Studio Code.

[Installation instructions for ZLS](https://github.com/zigtools/zls#installation) can be found on the ZLS `README.md`. Once you run `zls config` it will walk you through configuring ZLS for Visual Studio Code and your installation of Zig.

In the future, we hope to make installing ZLS for Visual Studio Code much simpler.
